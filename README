Standard drill for install.

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

Special thanks to Robert Rothenberg for making some helpful suggestions.

This module was called Parse::Name, but after an email from Robert Rothenberg
I renamed it to Lingua::EN::Parse::PersonsName. Kind of long but more accurate.
This module is something I've been meaning to do for a long time. I use this
as more of a delegate in a class to handle English names than an object to be
used by it's self, but there is nothing wrong with using it that way.
